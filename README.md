## Introduction
This repository demonstrates how to model basic logic gates using neural networks. Each logic gate is implemented using a small neural network with one or more layers, showcasing the ability of neural networks to learn simple logical operations.

## Installation
To run the code in this repository, you'll need Python and the following packages:

numpy
You can install the required packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy
 
## Usage
Each logic gate is implemented as a class with methods to activate the gate with given inputs. Below are the details and usage examples for each gate.

AND Gate
The AND gate is implemented using a single neuron with appropriate weights and biases.

import numpy as np
